### Welcome to BlocklyMBED.
BlocklyMBed is a a web-based visual programming editor for [Mbed](http://www.mbed.org/).

BlocklyMbed is based on [Blockly](http://code.google.com/p/blockly/), the web-based, graphical programming editor 
and [BlocklyDuino](https://github.com/gasolin/BlocklyDuino). 
BlocklyMBED Provides static type language blocks and code generators for mbed programming.


[BlocklyDuino has a Google+ Page](https://plus.google.com/111979846292233941175).

### Features

* Programming MBED with visually drag and drop code blocks
* Generate fully compatible mbed source code
* Compile+link the source and provide a binary for download
* Load different on-site examples with url parameters

### Demo

BlocklyMbed is a web tool. You can give it a try at
[Web](http://compiler.kekbot.org) to see the working BlocklyMbed.

### Run locally on your web browser

If you want to install it locally. Get code from github and open blockly/demos/blocklyduino/index.html in your browser.

The preffered way is to put the BlocklyDuino/web folder into a web server and open the url like localhost/public/blockly/demos/blocklyduino/index.html for use.

### Usage (3 Step)

1. Open browser to BlocklyDuino, Drag and Drop blocks to make arduino program. 
2. Select 'Arduino' tab to copy source code to Arduino IDE
3. press 'upload' button to burn the code into arduino
